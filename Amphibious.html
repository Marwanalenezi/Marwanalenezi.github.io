  <li><p><strong><em>Above Left</em></strong>: An American alligator. This abundant predator is almost synonymous with Floridian wildlife. This large male was found basking in a pond by a gas station.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong><em>Above Middle</em></strong>: A West Indian manatee at the break of dawn in Crystal River. This manatee was grazing, which is what they spend most of their time doing, particularly in the winter.</p>

  <li><p><strong><em>Above Left</em></strong>: A manatee mother and calf at Three Sisters Spring. Mothers tend to rear their calfs for up to two years. This calf is around six months old.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong><em>Above Middle</em></strong>: A softshell turtle in Blue Grotto Springs, Williston. Aptly named, these reptiles have an elongated nose they use like a snorkel to maximize bottom time.</p>
  <li><p><strong><em>Above Right</em></strong>: A tourist swimming with a manatee in Hunter Spring. Crystal River makes much of its income from eco-tourism.</p></li>
