<p id="bio">My name is Marwan Alenezi. I was born in Kuwait and moved to Florida to study journalism at the University of Miami. My passion for photojournalism stems primarily from my fascination and love for the animal kingdom. I try to identify any species I photograph, but mistakes do happen. If any animal is falsely identified, please let me know! Photography and filmmaking are the best ways to get us closer to nature, which is becoming ever more vital at this point in human history. All the photos in these galleries were taken in Florida, and all of them are my own.</p>
