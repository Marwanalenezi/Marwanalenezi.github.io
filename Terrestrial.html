  <li><p><strong><em>Above Left</em></strong>: Turkey vultures in Downtown Miami. In the winter, these birds of prey fly down to Florida from the Northeast by the thousands.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong><em>Above Middle</em></strong>: A Moscovy duck in Coral Gables. The red flesh on a duck's face is called a caruncle, and is thought to increase odds of mating.</p>
  <li><p><strong><em>Above Right</em></strong>: A juvenile racoon peers from behind a tree trunk in Bill Baggs State Park in Key Biscayne.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong><em>Above Left</em></strong>: A Ibis overlooking Lake Osceola. The Ibis is the University of Miami mascot because it is the last animal to flee before a hurricane hits, as well as the first to reappear.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong><em>Above Middle</em></strong>: A green iguana basking in the sun. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals, and must use the environment to regulate body temperature and maintain homeostasis. This iguana is warming up after a dip in a nearby lake. They are excellent swimmers, thanks to their strong tails, and can hold their breath for over five minutes.</p>
  <li><p><strong><em>Above Right</em></strong>: A green heron perched on a rock on Lake Osceola. They are more nocturnal than durnal, and their low energy levels make them easier to photograph during the day.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong><em>Above Left</em></strong>: A white seagull perched on a shack on South Beach. Seagulls are one of the rare animals that are able to drink salt water. Special glands above their eyes eliminate salt from the body.</p></li>
